# Market-Crash-Predictability

This repository contains my **final project** along with two significant research papers on financial market crashes. Together, these materials provide both original analysis and historical perspectives on how option markets and statistical methods can signal impending crises.

## Contents

1. **Final Project (Notebook)**
   - File: `Aarushi_Singh_Final_Project.ipynb`
   - A comprehensive project applying quantitative finance methods to analyze market dynamics, option pricing, and risk modeling.

2. **Crash of ’87 – Was it Expected? (Paper)**
   - File: `Crash of 87.pdf`
   - Authors: Ramazan Gençay, Nikola Gradojevic (2006)
   - Examines belief heterogeneity and skewness premium in option markets leading up to the October 1987 market crash, using entropic measures of dispersion and q-Gaussian modeling.

3. **2008 Financial Crisis Paper**
   - File: `Paper_2008.pdf` (placeholder – to be added here)
   - Analysis of the 2008 financial crisis, its causes, and implications for risk management and systemic stability.

## Purpose

The repository is intended as both a research archive and an applied reference for:
- Studying how option pricing reveals aggregate market fears.
- Understanding methodologies (entropy, GARCH, q-Gaussian) for crash prediction.
- Comparing historical crises: 1987 vs. 2008, alongside a modern applied project.

## Future Applications

Potential extensions of this work include:
- Implementing predictive models for real-time crash detection using option data.
- Expanding entropy-based analysis to other asset classes (credit, commodities).
- Comparing predictive indicators across multiple historical crises (1929, 1987, 2008, 2020).
- Integrating machine learning with entropy-based risk measures for market surveillance.
